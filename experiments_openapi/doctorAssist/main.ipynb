Given that the patient has additional health concerns (specifically chronic kidney disease), the risk of worsening kidney function or other toxicities could be a significant concern.\n",

      "4. **Drug-Medication Interaction**: With a score of 0.3064, this suggests that there’s a substantial probability of interaction between Ibuprofen and the patient’s current medications (like Metformin and Lisinopril) that could lead to adverse effects or decreased effectiveness of either the Ibuprofen or the current medications.\n",
